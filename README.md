# Gaussian Picker

Inspired from the issue thread https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat/issues/728

But, it uses inference time gradient backpropagation to find the gaussian asset to be picked.

Assets are created with [Triplane Gaussian](https://github.com/VAST-AI-Research/TriplaneGaussian.git)

Sample assets can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f12KvqI_5fTxl-jDbPnbEZ37VAImJRa8/view?usp=sharing
